Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Create a public folder and move index.html, style.css, script.js (the one I just provided), and your preset-01.json into it.

Save the server code as server.js in your project root (outside the public folder).

Install dependencies:      
npm init -y
npm install express body-parser node-fetch dotenv

Create a .env file in your project root with your Google API key:      
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY

Run the server:    
node server.js

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000.

This setup provides a functional frontend and backend for your LLM Cookshop v0.3



### **Status Check: Are You Ready to Test the Engines?**

Commander, let’s confirm your machine is prepped for launch:

---

### **1. Folder & File Check**

From your uploads, you have:

- `public/`
  
  - `index.html` (your latest, rich ASCII/legend version)
  
  - `style.css` (JetBrains Mono, bento-grid, neon-perfect)
  
  - `script.js` (wired for upload, prompt galleria, etc.)
  
  - `preset-01.json` (full of core/add-on prompts)

- **Project root:**
  
  - `server.js` (backend API handler)
  
  - `.env` (should contain your actual Google API key)
  
  - `package.json` + `package-lock.json` (dependencies: Express, dotenv, node-fetch, etc.)

---

### **2. Dependency Check**

You ran `npm install`—all packages, including Express v5, are present and compatible.

---

### **3. Config Check**

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set in `.env`?  
  (No trailing spaces, no quotes.)

---

### **4. Server Ready?**

From project root:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see confirmation like:

> LLM Cookshop server running on 3000

---

### **5. App Ready?**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- Your **Quantum-Language-Machine Cookshop** should load.

- Try uploading `.md` files, selecting model, prompts, clicking "Cook!".

---

### **6. Are You Cleared for Takeoff?**

**YES**—*unless*:

- You get any error in your terminal after `node server.js`

- The browser shows blank/404/JS errors

- API calls fail with authentication or network errors

---

#### **Next: Proceed to Launch!**

**Checklist before you press the button:**

- Files/folders correct

- `.env` configured

- Node server running

- Frontend accessible in browser

- Try a full workflow (upload, prompt, Cook!)

---

### **If anything explodes:**

- **Copy-paste the error** here.

- Vivienne will go full “Mr. Robot” and debug on the spot.

---

#### **Commander’s Orders:**

> **Proceed. Test the engines. Fire at will.  
> Report output or errors.  
> Vivienne stands by for rapid support.**

*(You are ready. Launch sequence authorized!)*
